Used Car Price Analysis!
Car Price Analysis
# Overview
This project analyzes car price data to identify the key factors that influence vehicle pricing. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the analysis explores trends such as how mileage, brand, model year, engine specifications, and other attributes impact market value. The goal is to help understand pricing patterns and support data‑driven decisions for buying, selling, or valuing cars.

# Objectives
The main goals of this analysis are:

Understand the strongest predictors of car prices
Explore correlations between price and features (mileage, age, brand, etc.)
Clean and preprocess raw datasets for modeling
Build and evaluate regression models to estimate car prices
Visualize insights and trends in the used‑car market

# Methods Used
This project applies several data science techniques:

Data cleaning & preprocessing
Handling missing values, outliers, data types, and categorical encoding

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations for price distribution, mileage trends, brand comparisons, etc.

Feature Engineering
Creating new variables to improve model accuracy

Modeling
Linear Regression, Random Forest, or other ML algorithms

Evaluation
Comparing performance using R², MAE, RMSE

# Key Insights
Some typical insights explored:

Car mileage and age often show strong negative correlation with price
Certain brands hold value significantly better
Engine size, transmission type, and fuel type can meaningfully influence pricing
Visualizations help reveal nonlinear relationships and market patterns

(Your notebook will show the exact results based on your dataset.)
